"""Cancel a task once, and repeat a cancellation that AnyIO absorbed.

Two rules live here so that the second can be deleted on its own.

A task with a cancellation already in progress is never cancelled again.
httpcore closes a cancelled request's connection inside an AnyIO cancel shield,
which stops only AnyIO cancellation: a second raw ``Task.cancel()`` that lands
there aborts the close and leaves an ACTIVE connection in the shared pool for
good.

A cancellation that AnyIO absorbed is repeated once. Until AnyIO ships the fix
for agronholm/anyio#1214 (PR #1330, merged after the 4.15.1 release), a
``Task.cancel()`` that lands in the same event-loop iteration as a cancel
scope's own cancellation is swallowed. ``anyio.connect_tcp`` cancels its group
of connection attempts the moment one succeeds, so a provider request cancelled
at that instant carries on as if it never was. A task that is still running,
with no cancellation in progress, shortly after being cancelled is cancelled
once more. Delete ``_cancel_again_if_absorbed`` and its scheduling, together
with the canary test in ``tests/test_cancellation.py``, once the locked AnyIO
includes that fix; the canary fails at that point to say so.
